            <div class ="content"><h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am a energetic, rational, passionate hands on learner who is very friendly and amalgamate myself very easily in any new environment. I am also a very just person  with a very strong sense of justice and fair play.</p>
                <p>I am an aspiring full stack developer and have completed my Bachelor of Engineering ( Information technology).</p>
                <p> I am proficient in many front-end technologies for creating presentable, readable and appealing UI with the help of technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript.</p>
                <p>
                    I am also comfortable working with back-end technologies which help enable the front-end of the system and create a wholesome user experience using object-oriented programming languages such as Java, Python.
                </p>
                <p>I am also good at understanding the inner workings of existing systems. I happen to have worked with and am familiar with creating data models and other UML diagrams which help other people understand and work comfortably with the system.</p>
                <p>I have also worked on various types of databases creating, querying and manipulating databases like Cassandra, MySql, MongoDB etc.  </p>
                
                <h3 class="beliefs">Belief and practices</h3>
                <p>I am a staunch believer in the use of Open -source software.</p> 
                <p>Open source software is software with source code that anyone can inspect, modify, and enhance. This system of open-source software allows for faster detection, assessment and removal of bugs and  vulnerabilities while allowing the software to grow at exponential rate due to other programmers who are also using this software for their own projects helping each other out in creating a better environment for software development in the future for each other.</p>
                <p>I also practice SWOT analysis for planning for future projects and keeping a realistic deadline. SWOT analysis is a strategic planning technique used to help a person or organization identify the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats related to project planning.</p>
                
                <h3>Hobbies and passions</h3>
                <p>I am a gourmand who has an ardent interest in food. I am also an inspired chef who believes that cooking good food is not only a art but also a science in itself.</p>
                <p>I am an avid gamer with a love for Turn-based Strategy games like Chess, Civilization series. I commonly also play competitive games like DOTA 2, CS GO with my buddies. I also love playing world building games like Rimworld. </p>
                <p> I am an animal lover who takes compassion and tries to help and save animals whenever possible</p>
